## [My war on animation](https://www.theverge.com/23191768/animation-accessibility-neurodivergence) by S.E. Smith for The Verge
Great read on accessibility and web design. Takeaways:
- There are a lot of access issues that we're not even aware of when discussing the topic of accessibility in web design right now.
- The solution to the problem is perhaps not to issue warnings of web content that wasn't formatted in a way that is accessible to all (still leaving people behind), but to give the end user more control over how a website works for them specifically, with alternative (often less cutting edge) ways to experience it for them. 

But apart from that the author also has a point: there is way too much animated or moving content on websites and I'm not just talking about autoplaying video.
