I've always enjoyed writing. I've done it for as long as I can remember. And I've loved the world wide web since I first started using it, at the local library that I used to bike to about twice a week just to get online.

The first writing-for-the-web project I undertook was a website about the country of Uganda, of all things. I was a prepubescent teen then, a bit of a weird kid, and I'd become fascinated by the country after reading a [comic book](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_dorpstiran_van_Boeloe_Boeloe) set in a fictional nation that was based on it. I did done my own research - my father's full set of the Winkler Prins encyclopedia proved essential in this endeavour - and I started writing about the country's history, geography, nature ... with the purpose of publishing it online at some point. 

I never got that far, but I did have a little program on our home computer that I could use to lay-out the pages and create hyperlinks between them, as well as fashion a little menu to tie the whole website together. I had the concept, and I had the content, and I imagine if we'd had internet at home back then I would have turned it into a GeoCities website.

As it stood, it would take a couple more years until I started writing for the web. That was at university, where I started a blog, first on Blogger, then Wordpress and eventually Livejournal. The first two I had trouble motivating myself to maintain, but on LJ I found my niche. The site was something in between a blog and a social network, to be honest, and I had a lot of fun writing something in between what I then considered typical blog content (semi-but-not-quite journalistic) and more personal writing.

I wrote book reviews, movie reviews and TV recaps, expressed my thoughts and opinions on things like politics and LGBTQI+ issues and described a lot of the minutiae that make up the bulk of my life. I did all of this without (too much) fear of being called out for not being enough of an expert to have a say on any of it.[^1] I was proud of some of what I produced, and I definitely tried to do it well, but hindsight is 20/20. The real joy I had in doing it came from just being creative, getting stuff out there, and not caring too much about what people's opinions might be.[^2]

Then a Russian company bought Livejournal and made some unpopular changes. People started to leave, Tumblr was the new kid on the block, and I followed them eventually. I was a keen reblogger on there, but my original output dwindled. I kept it up for a couple of years, until I accidentally locked myself out of my account - a mishap with multi-factor authentication - and Tumblr refused to believe I was, in fact, still me.[^3] So that was that.

I didn't stop writing after that, but the writing I have done since has been very intermittent (as it was already in my Tumblr days) and saved only as personal notes. But for as long as that has been the case, however, I've longed to get back into the habit of publishing part of what I write online. A desire for perfection, for at least a facade of professionalism, held me back. I came up with ambitious plans, but meanwhile never got beyond writing the about-section and failing to even deliver a version of that that I considered worthy. Basically, I lost track of what had made writing fun for me.

I left things as they were, not knowing how to get out of that loop. And then about a year ago I happened upon the concept of a digital garden. I don't remember how I encountered it or which digital garden I first visited, but I remember [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/)s and [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/)'s to have been among the first. A seed (pardon the pun) was planted.

As to what a digital garden is, let me leave it up to Chuck Grimmett to [explain the basics](https://cagrimmett.com/notes/2020/11/08/what-are-digital-gardens/). MIT Technology Review also has a nice write-up [over here](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). And Maggie Appleton wrote a short [history of the digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Great read if you're interested.

As to what I plan to do with mine, I explain all of that [[about this website\|here]] (coming soon).

[^1]: I still did my research, but on Blogger and Wordpress I put the bar so high for myself - I really wanted to come across as an expert of sorts on whatever I wrote about - that I didn't really get much writing done at all. On LJ I learned to leave well enough alone.
[^2]: Full disclosure: of *course* I enjoyed positive feedback and got frustrated with the odd negative comment. After all I'm only human. But it didn't stop me in my tracks like it would have before.
[^3]: My Tumblr is [still out there](https://mrhappyboots.tumblr.com/) now, frozen in time. My LJ was locked - only LJ users that I approved could read it - and I've deleted it since, though I do still have an archive of my posts.
