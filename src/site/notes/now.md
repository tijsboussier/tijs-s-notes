## Current focuses  
- My boyfriend and I bought an apartment in Brussels around a year ago. The **renovation** is taking longer than we'd hoped and is an ongoing project.
- I have been slowly trying to get back into the habit of **cooking** after a summer in which I did very little of it, due to a hit to my mental health. And regarding that: Healing isn't a straight line, but I'm in therapy and making progress.
- Currently in my fifth year of **Polish classes**, also my final one. Polish is the only language I'm currently doing any studying of, which is unusual for me. (Suffice to say Duo to my right here is not happy with me at the moment.) I might pick up more again in future, but I first need to get my bearings re:mental health a bit more.
- Taking another look at [**digital gardens**](https://cagrimmett.com/notes/2020/11/08/what-are-digital-gardens/). I've set up a very preliminary version of one of my own here. I think it might be a good way for me to flex my writing muscles and play around with coding, things I used to really enjoy and do much more of.
- I've been playing a lot of **[CK3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_Kings_III)**.

## In the past month
- I went to see **Angel Olsen** in concert. She was wonderful. She's not just a great singer with really great songs, but she's also funny. I loved her banter in between songs.
- I went on a **day trip** to Charleroi. I can recommend [Livre ou verre](https://livreouverre.be/) , where we started our day, for coffee and/or (francophone) books. The rest of the day was spent checking out the [unnecessary and unfinished tramlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleroi_Metro) of the city, including an abandoned station.
- I saw two **movies** in theatre: *Triangle of Sadness* and *Everything Everywhere All At Once*.
