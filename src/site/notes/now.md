# what i'm doing now
<p class="date">Now-page inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">Derek Sivers</a>. November edition. Last updated on 17 November 2022.</p>

#### current focuses
- My boyfriend and I bought an apartment in Brussels around a year ago. The renovation is ongoing/barely even started.
- I took a hit to my mental health this year that culminated in a bit of a crisis in summer. Healing isn't a straight line, but I'm in therapy and making progress.
- Currently in my sixth year of Polish classes, also my final one. Polish is the only language I'm currently doing any studying of (unusual for me), but I'm managing to not beat myself up over that.
- I'm building my own website. You're on it now! [[manifesto\|More on that here.]]

#### this month
- I went on a day trip to La Louvière. Not to see the city; we spent the afternoon walking along the Canal du Centre to see the [four historic hydraulic boat lifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_Lifts_on_the_Canal_du_Centre) that are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. And because we're nerds for this stuff we also passed by the [Strépy-Thieu boat lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Str%C3%A9py-Thieu_boat_lift) - one of the tallest boat lifts in the world - that replaced them for barge traffic.

- I spent a morning learning about and discussing the poetry of Remco Campert at Mechelen's public library (beautiful building!). My sister had invited me and we agreed afterward we should do this more often. It really took me back to my university days.
- Pink Screens (a queer film festival) was in town this month. I went to a lot of screenings - like, a *lot* a lot - and really enjoyed this year's selection of movies.
- I'm still playing a lot of [CK3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_Kings_III).
