<p class="introduction">Hi there. I'm Tijs.</p>

###### the basics
He/him. 80s kid. Born and bred in Belgium. Current homebase: Brussels.

###### work
I work as a policy advisor on educational technology at KU Leuven's Faculty of Arts. I coordinate and guide projects at the intersection of education and technology, I help teaching staff figure out how our various ed tech tools work and could be implemented in their classes and I organise and lead trainings. I also manage the university's LMS for the Faculty and do tech support.

But I'm not here to talk about work. 

###### personal project
I like to write, and I like to mess around with code. For a couple of years I've only been doing that behind lock and key. 
- It wasn't always like that. My [[writing journey\|writing journey]].
- Now I'm once again creating a public space for it. [[manifesto\|More on that here.]]

My private life will seep through everything I do on here. For a quick rundown of the kinds of things that occupy my time, there is the [[now\|now page]] (coming soon).

A sizable chunk of my life I've spent online. Part of this website will be making inventory of that. For instance: these are the online [[online public spaces\|public spaces]] I'm using or have used.
