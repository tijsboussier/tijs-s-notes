# online public spaces
<p class="date">First posted on 16 November 2022</p>
<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ececec; padding-bottom: 1em;">This is a list of online public spaces that I have or once had an account on. They are all websites and apps that I use/used to use to share some of my life on with the wider world. Limited (mostly) to services I was an active user of at some point. Non-exhaustive; going by memory. Presented alphabetically.</p>

**Blogger** <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">†</span>
  First blog. Content is fully deleted (as far as I can tell). For a long time couldn't delete my Blogger profile itself, but checked while writing this and Google allows you to do this now.

**Dreamwidth** <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">†</span>
  Was supposed to be the new Livejournal after Livejournal was sold to a Russian company. Made an account, never did anything with it.

**Facebook** <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">†</span>
  On it soon after Facebook came to Belgium. Was fun for a bit, but as the newness wore off and newer iterations of the platform introduced more clutter I became much less active. Deleted my account in the wake of the very many bad ways FB was in the news over the last couple of years. Exported my data beforehand and have an archive of a selection of my content.

**Goodreads** <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">†</span>
  Social book and reading cataloging website. Used it to keep track of my reading and to follow what one or two of my friends on there had read/were reading. Also assigned stars to each book I read and participated in the reading challenges once or twice. Never very active (I often forgot to update it), I deleted my account after Amazon bought Goodreads.

**Habbo Hotel** <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">†</span>
  Virtual chat room, now known as Habbo. Came for the cute Pixel art, wanted to stay for connections made, but that never happened. Even online I'm socially awkward. Don't think I tried for long though.

**[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mrhappyboots/)** 
  Still using, not very active. Locked account. 

**[LinkedIn](https://be.linkedin.com/in/tijs-boussier)**
  I have one. Enough said.

**Listography** <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">†</span>
  For obsessive list makers (guilty!). Every list gets is its own card, can be put on 'main', 'ongoing' and 'archive' pages, which are public, or on a private page for lists you don't want to share. Simple default design with simple customisation options. Honestly, this was fun, but I wasn't using it a lot and got rid of it in the end. Definitely an inspiration for the lists I publish on here.

**Livejournal** <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">†</span>
  Third blog, also a social network. Knew people who were already on it and met a couple of new people there, too. This one I used a *lot* a lot. Where I found my niche re:the kind of longer-form content I like to write. Left after LJ was sold to a Russian company and deleted my account eventually, but have an archive of all my content.

**Myspace** <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">†</span>
  Had one. Liked playing around with the profile customisation options, but other than that don't remember using it much (or even knowing a lot of people who did). Think I left before Facebook was even around.

**Noxa** <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">†</span>
  Belgian social network. Became a member in late teens because friends were on it. Nerdy design, dark background with tiny font, profile page basically a bunch of boxes like Myspace. Limited customisation options. Spent a lot of time on there, filling out and playing around with my profile, chatting to people, reading the fora. Probably left around the time I went to uni. I think back on my time on there fondly and finding out it's still around and doesn't even look very different warms my heart.

**[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/@70Gddp2cTN09cg4dh8A47c5Acqg7T28fR33Tj2U925L05bB0Z7b21Z78a7dfX62d?src=navbar)**
  Social bookmarking and read-it-later service, tool of choice for saving articles and blog posts I want to read but don't have the time for immediately. List and archive private by default (option to have a public RSS feed for them) but also has a profile page where a user can share reading recommendations. Did this for a while. Tested if it still worked a while ago and it does, but now there's two links to the same article (one with and one without a comment) that send up an error message when I try to delete them. Confirms my impression that this functionality is no longer a priority for Pocket after Mozilla bought it; no updates for years and missing basics such as an edit option for a user's comments. Sad, this had potential.  

**[Tumblr](https://mrhappyboots.tumblr.com/)**
  Microblog and social network. Quite active reblogger, which sometimes involved adding a (public) note to something somebody else had posted. Not a lot of original output and less as time went on. Loved it though and learned a lot on it re:social and racial justice. Was locked out of my account after a mishap with MFA, Tumblr refuses to believe I am me. Lives on, frozen in time.

**[Twitter](https://twitter.com/tijsboussier)**
  Had an account from the very early days on, when it was new and creative and fun. Tweeted a lot back then. Did that less and less as time went on and eventually deleted my account. Made a new one a couple of years ago when I couldn't see (all of) people's profiles anymore without logging in. I don't post though.

**Wordpress** <span style="font-size: 1.4em;">†</span>
  Second blog. Updated it more than Blogger, but tried to be very serious about it. That was a mistake; never fully got the hang of it. Nothing preserved.
