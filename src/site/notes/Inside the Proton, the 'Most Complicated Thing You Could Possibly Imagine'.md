## [Inside the Proton](https://www.quantamagazine.org/inside-the-proton-the-most-complicated-thing-imaginable-20221019/) by Charlie Wood and Merrill Sherman for Quanta
There's a famous quote that's attributed to Richard Feynman: "If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics." As is the case with a lot of famous quotes, whether he actually ever said it (and whether the wording is correct) is contentious at best.

Niels Bohr, on the other hand, did definitely say "Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it." We know this because it's printed in a book authored by the person he said it to. Good enough for me.

More importantly, not the point. Quantum physics is weird, counterintuitive and still mysterious decades into its research. It's reportedly impossibly hard to grasp even for experts and none of the articles I've read about it - popular science, but I like to think they're at the intermediate reader level - have been able to explain it to me in a way I can fully understand.

Not different for this article about one of the most famous of reality's building blocks, but it got close. It does a really good job of describing what we know a proton is and consists of, and how we know it. Just don't ask me to summarise it in a way that's clear or concise; I can't. But I can guarantee I at least had the impression I understood it while I was reading it. That may not sound like a big achievement, but I assure you it is. And that, too, is good enough for me.
