## _Gideon the Ninth_ by Tamsyn Muir

Is it sci-fi? Is it fantasy? Who cares! (It's fantasy.)

I did kind of figure out which general direction the story was going to go in early on in the novel, but that didn't reduce my enjoyment of it. I hope future instalments of the series explore different locations, because the action in the first one is almost entirely limited to the one and the glimpses you do get of the wider world are wildly fascinating. I want more!

As for me starting any of those future instalments: I would love to do it right now, but sadly I can't find them to buy at a decent enough price and my library doesn't have them, so I'm going to have to wait a bit.
