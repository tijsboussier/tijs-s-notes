## _Bonita Avenue_ by Peter Buwalda
<img src="https://standaarduitgeverij.be/cover/cover.php?isbn=9789023475705" style="float: left; padding: 0 1em; width: 30%;" />Impressive for a debut for sure and generally I liked it, but the amount of critical acclaim this book got when it was first published was perhaps a tad excessive. Fit nicely into the mould of the generational/family novel, but did nothing to break that.
