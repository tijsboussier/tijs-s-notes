<p class="introduction">Hello there. I'm Tijs.</p>
I am 37 years old, was born and grew up in Belgium, and I currently live in Brussels with a boyfriend and a cat.

I work as an expert on educational technology at KU Leuven's Faculty of Arts. I advise teaching staff on the use of ed tech in- and outside of the classroom, organise and lead trainings on the qualitative implementation of various technologies in educational settings and coordinate and guide projects that are situated at the intersection of education and technology. I also manage the university's LMS for the Faculty and a sizable portion of my work is tech support.

But I'm not here to talk about work. This website is a personal project. There's a lot of things that I'm interested in and love. Sometimes I write about them. I'm collecting that writing here.
