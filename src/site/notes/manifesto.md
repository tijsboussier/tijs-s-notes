# what is this place?
<div style="background-color: #B5D6D6; padding: 5px; border-radius: 10px;"><p style="padding: 5px;">I'm on version 4 of trying to explain what this website is. This is the best version so far.</p></div>

<p class="introduction">This is my digital garden. I call it that because digital gardens are what this website was inspired by, but 'personal playground' might be a better description. For now it's a collection of various of my writings (long-form, notes, lists ...) both new and old, but it's meant to be a living, breathing thing. Not because I'm still figuring out what I want to use this website for, but because figuring that out as I go along is the entire idea. If there's a concept, that's the one: exploration and experimentation; process, not product.</p>

Throughout my life online I have used a [[online public spaces\|variety of spaces]] to publish and share the parts of my life that I feel comfortable sharing, in a variety of ways (blogs, lists, social media ...). The first half of my twenties I largely spent sat behind a computer, writing or reacting to what friends had written,[^1] and thinking back on those times I feel nostalgic. But things change. Most of those spaces I've since left. A lot of the accounts I've purged entirely, others still exist but I've largely abandoned.

There are different reasons for that. Sometimes I was disillusioned by the platforms themselves (changes or limitations in their functionality, or - in the case of Facebook - management implemented policies or supported politics that I could not get behind).[^2] Sometimes a platform I liked (LiveJournal, Goodreads) got bought by a company I despised (SUP media and Amazon respectively). And sometimes I just grew out of it.

The urge to share stuff publicly online, the urge to have a space to do that on, never fully left me, however. And neither did the desire to have a website of my own, that I could shape however I wanted. Different jobs I've had required me to teach myself and use HTML, CSS and JS and it's something I've always enjoyed. I often thought about taking that knowledge and creating something of my own with it, but I never actually pursued it. The persistent voice in my head telling me *you're not good enough* had a big part to play in that.

And well, no more. This time I'm doing it. But - what is it that I'm actually doing?

#### It's personal
Everything on here was written by me and (mainly) designed by me. It's a space for self-expression and -exploration, somewhere I can allow my creative juices to run wild and free. At this moment I imagine that will include things I'm already somewhat good at (writing), things I know one or two things about and want to get better at (coding) and things I have not done very often at all but want to do more of (drawing).

As to content, anything goes. I have a wide range of interests to choose from and I like talking about all of them. That's true for books, movies, music and podcasts that I've read, watched and listened to. It's also the case for thoughts or opinions I have on current societal issues, such as topics that concern the LGBTQIA+ community and the climate crisis. I'm also interested in languages, technology, the media and publishing businesses. I enjoy cooking. I've recently taken to CK3 in a big way and I'm currently trying out cardiac coherence as a relaxation technique. I want a space to be able to talk about all of that and more, if and when I feel like it. To see the connections, and to have a record of it.

Recently I've also been thinking a lot about my past, trying to remember parts of it that are hazy. I feel an urge to preserve it somehow. I might do that on here, too. Things might get personal.

#### It's not a blog
Sometimes notes of mine develop into long-form texts that are well-researched, written in full sentences and that have a clear point of view. Sometimes I even get lucky and they are almost good. I enjoy it when they do. There will be space for texts like that on here.

Those texts would feel right at home on a blog. But this is not a blog. If I would call this website that, I'd be loading it up with expectations - about frequency of posting, topicality of the content, form/genre of the texts ... - that I don't want to meet. I'm aware that not all blogs are created equal and therefore the person that would be setting those expectations is really just me. That doesn't make them feel any less oppressive, however.

So I'm rejecting them. I just want to play around.

#### It's something of a wiki
I'm an avid note-taker and list-maker. Those currently reside mainly on Workflowy. My full collection of notes haven't developed - like they do for some - into a  personal wiki representing the knowledge I have gathered so far. I don't know if that's what I want this website to become, either.

But pages are going to be linked like they would be on a wiki and backlinks between them are probably going to be a more interesting way of navigating them than a chronological feed, if I choose to add one. It's also entirely possible that sometimes a group of notes might become something like a personal wiki on that specific topic.

I'm also taking the perpetual unfinishedness of wikis/digital gardens on board. No page on this website is necessarily in its final form or finished. In fact some are specifically designed to be edited and added to over time.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://filedn.eu/lk3agvt89YPVfVtjPtpWrdX/its-alive-young-frankenstein.gif" /></p>

So like a wiki in some ways. But it's still not an explicit aim of this place.

#### Doing it in plain view
Nothing I've described so far I couldn't also just do in my various notes apps. But doing it publicly forces me to work harder at it. To consider things more deeply. To give it a decent go before I click 'Publish'. Not to arrive at a finished product (this website is about process, not end result), but to get those good vibes that you get from putting effort into something you enjoy and ending up with something that's half good, that you can look at and be somewhat proud of. Until you aren't anymore and you go back in to make it better.

###### In summary
This is a lot of explaining what it is I'm doing here. But what it bottles down to is this: I want to have space to express myself and play, be creative.

Real expression requires a public space, which is why I'm not doing this in private. It doesn't require a huge audience, however. I don't really care if nobody ever finds this website. This is a personal project.

Play requires flexibility, both in structure and form. That is why it's more of a wiki than a blog (but not quite a wiki). That is also why I'm building this website from scratch, using a couple of existing tools to help me along to be sure, but not choosing to go with a major platform. A major platform would definitely make the start-up process easier and smoother, but curtail my options for how I want to present things and how I want them to relate to each other.

I'm going to be playing around with text; I'll be trying my hand at different types of content. I'll also be playing around with presentation, designing the look of this place myself, using my own pictures and drawings where I see fit.

###### One final thing
In its simplest form this website is a set of Markdown files on my laptop, backed up to the cloud, that I then push to GitHub and Netlify, as well as pictures that I save in a public folder on (one of my) cloud storage provider's servers. I'm also writing and maintaining a CSS file on GitHub to make adjustments to a standard theme that came with the software stack I'm using. I have full control over the different links in the chain. That, too, is important to me.
